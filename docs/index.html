  <h2>Working With You</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
    <p>I listen, and then work tirelessly for the things that matter to you.</p>
    <p>Since my election in 2013, I've worked with community groups and residents to make our area a better place to live and work.</p>
    <p>I love to hear your thoughts and concerns by e-mail or phone, and I can come visit you at home.</p>
    <p>As long as I am your elected representative I promise I will continue to listen, work hard, and do the very best I can to help you.</p>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a Warwick University graduate, married with a grown up son. I have had a varied career including lecturing and voluntary sector management. My most recent work was at Nottinghamshire County Council working directly with small businesses to help them towards a sustainable future.</p>
    <p>I have been a school governor since 1992 and use my experience as Chair in primary and secondary schools to work with Governors in schools facing challenges. I mentor Chairs new to the role including the (then) newly appointed Chair of Governors at Chilwell School where I am now a governor. We were delighted to get a ‘good’ rating from Ofsted in 2015.</p>
    <p>As well as being a Beeston Councillor I am Lead member for Children’s Social Care for the County. I regularly speak up on children’s behalf and did so at a recent Council meeting to say that ‘there is a human cost when services to vulnerable people are underfunded… if social care is not properly funded by central government, more people will be left isolated with vital services taken away.’</p>
    <p>I am delighted to have been selected for the new seat of Beeston Central and Rylands: I do hope to be able to continue my work with you after the County Council elections on 4 May 2017.</p><br>

<h2>What I'm working on</h2>

<h3>Fighting for Families, Children, and Young People</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
  <p>For families, children and young people: as a School Governor and as Vice Chair of the Children and Young Peoples Committee I work hard with officers to provide good, value for money services and love to visit and offer support.</p>

  <blockquote>Your continued support makes a great difference to how we allocate additional provision to children, they are very lucky to keep receiving improvements to their environment. You are a true friend of the School.
    <cite>Headteacher of a Beeston School</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Since 2012 I've been a National Leader of Governance, working directly with Governors facing big challenges in their schools. I've got over 20  years experience as a Chair of Governors in Primary and Secondary Schools and am currently a Governor of Chilwell School, recently given a ‘good’ rating by Ofsted.</p>

<h3>Beeston Community Resource Centre</h3>


<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
    <p>One of my proudest achievements as a County Councillor has been to work with Beeston Community Resource to enable them to make a wonderful job of creating a great community hub.</p>

    <blockquote>Thank you Kate on behalf of everyone at BCR, for your unswerving support of our enterprise from our first request late in 2014 to be allowed to manage the Centre. The Centre is thriving and able to provide support and facilities to a wide range of individuals and community bodies. Your engagement and advocacy has been of crucial importance to our progress’ I would love to continue to support BCR and to work with other groups in Beeston; I have several currently in the pipeline.
      <cite>Graham Machin, Chair of Beeston Community Resource</cite>

    <h3>Supporting the most vulnerable</h3>

    <p>There is a human cost when services to vulnerable people are not properly funded. I have seen first-hand as Lead Member for Social care how Nottinghamshire County Council social care staff work day in day out caring for Nottinghamshire people. I actively support their work, fight to protect the social care budget and signpost residents to help whenever they need it.</p>

    <blockquote>Kate this is a remarkable service and we are delighted by the prompt help and support we received.
      <cite>Linda (local resident, giving feedback for the Handy Adaption Service)</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Public transport links</h3>

    <p>Bus services have been under threat due to severe budget cuts from central government, so I was delighted to be able to persuade Notts County Council to re-route the 510 bus to take in Long Lane.</p>
    <p>I could not have done it without your support. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Canalside Heritage Centre</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
    <p>The Canalside Heritage Centre is an exciting project in Beeston, part funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. I have been delighted to support it, through County Council funding bids and helping to get the word out in the wider community. There is an annual open day held in September at the Boat and Horses Pub, I joined  the fund raising with a plant stall last year. There was loads of activity including dancing, craft making, tea and cake.  We we all got a bit cold and wet, but still managed to raise some money between us for this briliant project.</p>
    <p>The Grand Opening is in June - I hope to see you there!</p>

<h3>Improving facilities for our children</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
    <p>On a visit to County Hall, pupils at Rylands Junior School asked me if the play equipment at Leyton Crescent could be refurbished. I started to look for sources of funding and engaged the wonderful Rylander community in supporting the childrens request. I am pleased to report that we were successful in our bid to the County Councils Communities Fund.</p>
    <p>Many, many thanks for your support, your response was overwhelming; thanks especially to Cat Fairbrother, Jackie Moss and the Rylands School Council and Chris Riley at Broxtowe Borough.</p>
