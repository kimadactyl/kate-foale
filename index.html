<h2>What I'm working on</h2>

<h3>Fighting for Families, Children, and Young People</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
  <p>For families, children and young people: as a School Governor and as Vice Chair of the Children and Young Peoples Committee I work hard with officers to provide good, value for money services and love to visit and offer support.</p>

  <blockquote>Your continued support makes a great difference to how we allocate additional provision to children, they are very lucky to keep receiving improvements to their environment. You are a true friend of the School.
    <cite>Headteacher of a Beeston School</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Since 2012 I've been a National Leader of Governance, working directly with Governors facing big challenges in their schools. I've got over 20  years experience as a Chair of Governors in Primary and Secondary Schools and am currently a Governor of Chilwell School, recently given a ‘good’ rating by Ofsted.</p>

<h3>Beeston Community Resource Centre</h3>


<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
    <p>One of my proudest achievements as a County Councillor has been to work with Beeston Community Resource to enable them to make a wonderful job of creating a great community hub.</p>

    <blockquote>Thank you Kate on behalf of everyone at BCR, for your unswerving support of our enterprise from our first request late in 2014 to be allowed to manage the Centre. The Centre is thriving and able to provide support and facilities to a wide range of individuals and community bodies. Your engagement and advocacy has been of crucial importance to our progress’ I would love to continue to support BCR and to work with other groups in Beeston; I have several currently in the pipeline.
      <cite>Graham Machin, Chair of Beeston Community Resource</cite>

<h3>Supporting the most vulnerable</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="content">
    <p>There is a human cost when services to vulnerable people are not properly funded. I have seen first-hand as Lead Member for Social care how Nottinghamshire County Council social care staff work day in day out caring for Nottinghamshire people. I actively support their work, fight to protect the social care budget and signpost residents to help whenever they need it.</p>

    <blockquote>Kate this is a remarkable service and we are delighted by the prompt help and support we received.
      <cite>Linda (local resident, giving feedback for the Handy Adaption Service)</cite>
    </blockquote>

<h3>Public transport links</h3>

<p>Bus services have been under threat due to severe budget cuts from central government, so I was delighted to be able to persuade Notts County Council to re-route the 510 bus to take in Long Lane. Again, I could not have done it without your support. Thank you.</p>

<h3>Canal Side Heritage Centre</h3>
